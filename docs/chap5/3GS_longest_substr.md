# **3„ÄÅLongest substring**

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

* Input: s = "abcabcbb"
* Output: 3
* Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.


* Input: s = "bbbbb"
* Output: 1
* Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.



* Input: s = "pwwkew"
* Output: 3
* Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.

Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
