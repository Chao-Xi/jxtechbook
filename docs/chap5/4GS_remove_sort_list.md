# **4„ÄÅRemove duplicate in Sort List**

* Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. 
* Return the linked list sorted as well.



* Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
* Output: [1,2,5]


* Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
* Output: [2,3]
